# PG1350 Kicad symbols & footprints

PG1350 symbols and footprints heavily inspired by [@PJE66](https://github.com/PJE66). 

## Symbol

Includes the diode in the symbols. Taken from [@PJE66](https://github.com/PJE66), but with some of the pins hidden as they are not needed for external connections. A switch without diode can be just represented with a normal push button.

## Footprints

Uses choc LED hole for (optional) SOD-123 diode placement, and the internal connections are already made. For the reversible footprint, a via is used inside of the pads to connect the diodes on both sides, and silkscreens are duplicated on both sides. For the footprint with diodes, the center is placed on the center of the diode to help with PCBA. **The outline draws the actual keycap size (16.5x17.5mm) instead of choc spacing (17x18mm)!**
