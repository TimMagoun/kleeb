# Keeb Libs

This is a collection of the Kicad symbols, footprints and 3D models I use in my keyboards. **I do not claim copyright to any of the files here. Some of them are circulated on Discord servers and some are obtained from other sites.** I may have created some of them, but I can't confirm. I have modified some of them for correctness and/or for my own needs. They are only here as a way to better manage what I use, and this is only public because otherwise I wouldn't be able to share my keyboard designs. If you have a problem with how I'm using/distributing them please let me know.
