# PG1350 Kicad symbols & footprints

PG1350 symbols and footprints heavily inspired by @PJE66. 

## Symbol

Includes the diode in the symbols. Directly taken from @PJE66. A switch without diode can be just represented with a normal push button.

## Footprints

Uses choc LED hole for (optional) SOD-123 diode placement, and some of the connections are already made. For the reversible footprint, a via is used inside of the pads to connect the diodes on both sides, and silkscreens are duplicated on both sides. For the footprint with diodes, the center is placed on the center of the diode to help with PCBA. **Draws the keycap size (16.5x17.5mm) instead of choc spacing (17x18mm)!**
